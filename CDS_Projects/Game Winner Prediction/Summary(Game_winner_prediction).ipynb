Analysis\n","The analysis is done by analyzing the various features of the data. It has 29 features which plays important role in analysis of data with many prespectives. Many packages such as numpy, pandas,etc., are used to analyze the fearures. The features are categorized into Numerical and Categorical Datas. \n","\n","#### Numerical Data\n","Numerical features are the values which varies in a particular range and classified as discrete, continuous, or timeseries based. The Numerical Features as follows,\n"," 1   assists            \n"," 2   boosts             \n"," 3   damageDealt      \n"," 4   DBNOs              \n"," 5   headshotKills      \n"," 6   heals              \n"," 7   killPlace          \n"," 8  killPoints       \n"," 9  kills              \n"," 10  killStreaks        \n"," 11  longestKill      \n"," 12  matchDuration      \n"," 13  maxPlace           \n"," 14  numGroups          \n"," 15  rankPoints         \n"," 16  revives            \n"," 17  rideDistance     \n"," 18  roadKills          \n"," 19  swimDistance     \n"," 20  teamKills          \n"," 21  vehicleDestroys    \n"," 22  walkDistance     \n"," 23  weaponsAcquired    \n"," 24  winPoints          \n"," 25  winPlacePerc     \n","\n","#### Categorical Data \n","Categorical features are those which classify values into sets of similar samples and the values are nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based.

If the data is already structured and cleaned, there is no need for the data cleaning. In this case, the given data is well structured but contains few outliers and one missing value. \n","#### Outliers\n","* Kills without movement (1 player)\n","* Heals used are more than 35 (325 players)\n","* longest kill more than 1000mt away (20 players)\n","* Killing more than 30 (95 players)\n","* weapons aquired more than 45 (198 players)\n","These outliers has been dropped out of the data set.\n","\n","### Analysis by Visualization\n","To perform the analysis by the visualisation of the data in various forms are used in this project.

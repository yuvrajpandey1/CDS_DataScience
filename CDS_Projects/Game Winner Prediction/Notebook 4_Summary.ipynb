Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n","- headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n","- heals - Number of healing items used.\n","- Id - Player’s Id\n","- killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n","- killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player.

It has 29 features which plays important role in analysis of data with many prespectives. Many packages such as numpy, pandas,etc., are used to analyze the fearures. The features are categorized into Numerical and Categorical Datas. \n","\n","#### Game can be played in different modes which is categorized as follows\n","- solo  <-- solo,solo-fpp,normal-solo,normal-solo-fpp\n","- duo   <-- duo,duo-fpp,normal-duo,normal-duo-fpp,crashfpp,crashtpp\n","- squad <-- squad,squad-fpp,normal-squad,normal-squad-fpp,flarefpp,flaretpp \n","\n","#### Numerical Data\n","- Numerical features are the values which varies in a particular range and classified as discrete, continuous, or timeseries based. The Numerical Features as follows,\n"," 1   Assists            \n"," 2   Boosts             \n"," 3   DamageDealt      \n"," 4   DBNOs              \n"," 5   HeadshotKills      \n"," 6   Heals              \n"," 7   KillPlace          \n"," 8   KillPoints       \n"," 9   Kills              \n"," 10  KillStreaks        \n"," 11  LongestKill      \n"," 12  MatchDuration      \n"," 13  MaxPlace           \n"," 14  NumGroups          \n"," 15  RankPoints         \n"," 16  Revives            \n"," 17  RideDistance     \n"," 18  RoadKills          \n"," 19  SwimDistance     \n"," 20  TeamKills          \n"," 21  VehicleDestroys    \n"," 22  WalkDistance     \n"," 23  WeaponsAcquired    \n"," 24  WinPoints          \n"," 25  WinPlacePerc     \n","\n","#### Categorical Data \n","- Categorical features are those which classify values into sets of similar samples but here the Categorical means the datas in Text format, these do not have any order .
